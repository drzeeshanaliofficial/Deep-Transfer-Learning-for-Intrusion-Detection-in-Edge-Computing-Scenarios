Paper Title: Deep Transfer Learning for Intrusion Detection in Edge Computing Scenarios

Journal: IEEE Internet of Things

DOI: 10.1109/JIOT.2025.3597892

Overview: This work proposes a deep transfer learning approach for intrusion detection in edge computing environments.
We leverage Google BERT models (BERT-Base and BERT-Large) as feature extractors and train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the creation of a Supermodel using Deep Transfer Learning.

Our model is evaluated on two widely used intrusion detection datasets: 
NSL-KDD 2009 (Link: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)
CIC-IDS 2017 (Link: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)

This repository contains: BERT-Base and BERT-Large implementations. Each implementation is in its folder with all relevant Python files.
